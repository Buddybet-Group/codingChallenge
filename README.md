# FLUTTER CODING INTERVIEW

Welcome to the flutter coding challenge. 
For this task, you will be developing a nationality predicting application, which will allow users to input their name and predict/show the user's probable nationality.

It is reccomended to use the API availaible on this website: https://nationalize.io/
However, you are free to use any other source

We have developed a basic flutter application for you. Please ensure that you use *THIS* skeleton code to write your code and do not alter the AppBar Title

Please note the following:
- Pull the skeleton code on this repository, and make another branch called 'buddyBet' followed by your name (eg: "_buddyBet_Sid_"). 
- Complete the challenge on your branch, and the same will be considered submitted once you push the code this repository

## ALL THE BEST 

### BIG THANKS FOR THE OPPERTUNITY

Notes :

- Provided 2 sample test cases, we can cover everything incl "Injection" ( If we want )

- Errors are handled but not fully tested. ( Time limitation )

- Main focus here, architecture of the app, UI can be improved.

- To fetch country names, i used internal json file. ( Time limitation )

- Theme and Routes are not implemented.

- Along with theme implementation, the hardcoded fontSize / color properties will be removed. ( Again time limitations )
